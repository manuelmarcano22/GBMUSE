This proposal [7379](https://archive.stsci.edu/proposal_search.php?mission=hst&id=7379) by Edmonds with WFPC23 in the filters F336Q, F55W and F814W  was to 'make a detailed study of binaries'

## MUSE data

It was observed three times  with MUSE. First in 2014, 2015 and 2018 with exposures time ranging from 200.00 to 300 seconds. In 2018 it was observed as part of the MUSE narrow-filed mode during commissioning.


## Hubble data

There is [Hugs](https://archive.stsci.edu/prepds/hugs/) data
